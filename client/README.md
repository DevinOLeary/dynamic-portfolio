## This is my portfolio... for now
I am an emerging Front-end/Full-stack/Animation? developer.

I'm constantly adding tools to my tool belt, so this site is a living, breathing, sometimes aching project that will grow in complexity as my skills develop.

Currently it is comfortably built using `create-react-app`, `react-router 4`, `mobX` for state management, `SASS`,
`babel`, `npm`, `GSAP`, `axios`, `wordpress API`, and my `Sony a6000` camera.

Feel free to shoot me an email at djoleary07@gmail.com with any questions!

Cheers,
Devin
